# ðŸŽ­ AI Cosplay Studio

Welcome to my workspace.  
I'm building a local AI photo studio that lets you upload your photo and instantly transform it into a cosplay scene in any world.

âœ¨ **Core Idea:**  
> Change your clothes, background and lighting with AI â€” keep your face and style authentic.
